# TIC_TAC_TOE_AI
This project implements a classic game of TIC_TAC_TOE where a human player competes against an unbeatable AI.
The AI uses the Minimax alogorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to make optimal moves ensuring it always wins or forces a draw. 
The game is entirely text-based.
Game Rules are:
->Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) on an empty cell.
->The first player to get three symbols in a row,column,or diagonal is the winner.
->If the board is full and no player has won the game,then the game ends in a draw.
Let's check out how i implemented a unbeatable AI in "TIC_TAC_TOE.py"
